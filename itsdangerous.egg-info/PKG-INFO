# ItsDangerous

... so better sign this

Various helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it
back safe and sound. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a
token has not been tampered with.

It's possible to customize how data is serialized. Data is compressed as
needed. A timestamp can be added and verified automatically while
loading a token.


## A Simple Example

Here's how you could generate a token for transmitting a user's id and
name between web requests.

```python
from itsdangerous import URLSafeSerializer
auth_s = URLSafeSerializer("secret key", "auth")
token = auth_s.dumps({"id": 5, "name": "itsdangerous"})

print(token)
# eyJpZCI6NSwibmFtZSI6Iml0c2Rhbmdlcm91cyJ9.6YP6T0BaO67XP--9UzTrmurXSmg

data = auth_s.loads(token)
print(data["name"])
# itsdangerous
```
